Scenario 3: An unrelenting sun scorches Rohan's Eastfold
A brazen sun beats down with relentless fury upon the Eastfold of Rohan, baking the once fertile land until the very earth cracks and dust devils dance across the horizon. The wells have long since yielded their last drop, and the verdant fields, once rippling with grain, are now brittle and brown, offering no sustenance. The once-proud herds of horses and cattle are gaunt and few, their ribs showing beneath their parched hides. Across the desolate landscape, stonemasons and well-diggers, their faces grim with determination, seek what little work remains, their skills desperately needed. In the scattered settlements, healers, their knowledge taxed to its limit, brew what meager remedies they can against the fevers and sickness that grip the weakened populace.
